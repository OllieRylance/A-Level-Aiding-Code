# A-Level-Aiding-Code
While I studied Computer Science A-Level, there were concepts to do with problem solving and coding which we were taught the theory. This repository is how I tried to put some of those into programming.

## Classes

In 'classes.py' I tested a number of different functionalities of classes and objects in python.

What I learned from playing around with classes aided my understanding of the A-Level pre-release exam material as well as helping me do my NEA. Since A-Levels, I have now studied Object Oriented programming in more detail, and the foundation that this code and other practice using classes I have done laid has come in very useful.
