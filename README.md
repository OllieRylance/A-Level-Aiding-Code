# A-Level-Aiding-Code
While was studying my A-Levels, there were concepts to do with problem-solving and coding which we were taught the theory of. This repository is how I tried to put some of those into practice using programming.

## Maths - Averaging

In 'average.py', I put all of the different methods of finding the average of a dataset (from Maths) into practice. This was not too complicated but coding the averages reinforced my understanding of all of the scenarios that the way they work slights varies (i.e., the median changing slightly based on the number of items).

## Classes

In 'classes.py', I tested several different functionalities of classes and objects in Python.

What I learned from playing around with classes aided my understanding of the A-Level pre-release exam material as well as helping me do my NEA. Since A-Levels, I have now studied object-oriented programming in more detail, and the foundation that this code (and other practice using classes I had done) laid has come in very useful.

## Encyption

In 'encoder and decoder.py', there is the Python code for two methods of encryption. The first is the ol' reliable Caesar Cypher and the second is the keyword cypher. These both tend to come up a fair amount when learning encryption and I am happy I took the time to have a look at what is required to encode and decode them using a program.

## Probability Testing

In 'gamble.py', the code repeatedly tests the win rate of the following coin toss gambling strategy:
  
- Have a set starting bet size (small),
- Aim to get 1.5 times your initial balance by placing the starting bet repeatedly unless the last outcome of the coin toss was a loss, in which case you bet double the last bet size in a "double or nothing" manner.

## Maths - Matrix Multiplication

I remember learning matrix multiplication in maths and, although not understanding why it worked, thinking it could be programmed quite easily. This thought process led me to create 'matrix.py'.

In 'matrix.py', I created a function that takes a matrix and a matrix and a set of vectors. The function tests that the inputs can be multiplied before then proceeding with the multiplication.

Not too complicated but the concepts of 2D arrays and matrices are now quite normal to see in my degree so creating this program when the concepts were new to me must still help me with understanding the concepts.

## Sorting

In 'merge sort.py', I coded the two repeating steps of splitting and merging the dataset so that the efficiency of the code follows the big O notation of O(n log n), where 'n' represents the size of the dataset. This was a good short project to cement my understanding of the merge sorting process.
