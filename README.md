# A-Level-Aiding-Code
While I studied Computer Science A-Level, there were concepts to do with problem-solving and coding which we were taught the theory. This repository is how I tried to put some of those into programming.

## Classes

In 'classes.py', I tested several different functionalities of classes and objects in Python.

What I learned from playing around with classes aided my understanding of the A-Level pre-release exam material as well as helping me do my NEA. Since A-Levels, I have now studied object-oriented programming in more detail, and the foundation that this code (and other practice using classes I had done) laid has come in very useful.

## Maths - Averaging

In 'average.py', I put all of the different methods of finding the average of a dataset (from Maths) into practice. This was not too complicated but coding the averages reinforced my understanding of all of the scenarios that the way they work slights varies (i.e., the median changing slightly based on number of items).
